# Mention what command line can be used to load data into Django?

python manage.py loaddata: This command is used to load data from fixture files into your database.
Fixture files are serialized representations of Django models, usually stored in JSON, XML, or YAML format. 
The loaddata command can be used with the manage.py script in your Django project's root directory.
    
python manage.py loaddata <fixture_file>
    
python manage.py sqlsequencereset: This command is used to 
display the SQL statements that reset the database's auto-incrementing sequences for a given app.
It can be helpful when loading data that includes primary key fields and you want to ensure the 
integrity of the auto-incrementing sequence.
