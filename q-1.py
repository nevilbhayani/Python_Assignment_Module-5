# Why Django should be used for web-development? Explain how you can create a project in Django?


# Install Django: First, you need to install Django. You can do this using pip, Python's package manager, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
# ~ pip install django


# Create a Django Project:Once Django is installed, you can create a new Django project by running the following command:
# ~ python -m django startproject (projectnamne)


# Navigate to the Project Directory: Change into the newly created project directory
# ~ cd (projectname)


# Create Django Apps: Django projects are composed of multiple apps. You can create a new app within your project using the following command:
# ~ python manage.py startapp (appname)


# Run the Development Server: You can start the Django development server using the following command:
# ~ py manage.py runserver


# Define Models: Models represent the structure of your data. Define your models in the models.py file of your app.


# Create Views and Templates: Views handle the logic of your application, and templates determine the presentation. Create views in the views.py file and templates in the templates directory of your app.


# Configure URLs: Map URLs to views by defining URL patterns in the urls.py file of your app.


# Migrate Database: Once you define your models, you need to create database tables for them. Run the following command to apply migrations:
# ~ python manage.py makemigrations
# ~ python manage.py migrate


# Start Building: With your project set up, you can now start building your web application by adding more features, views, templates, and integrating with databases and other services as needed.
